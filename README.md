# ArduinoMidiKey
Make midi keyboard (controller) with Arduino.  
You can use switchs as a midi controller.  
Support Octave-Transport and Pitch-Shift.  
If arrange switchs like piano keyboard, you can make midi keyboard.  
Or arrange grid, you can make drampad.

In default,  
* 4 * 4 grid (16 pcs) switchs use as keyboard. (You can change size of pad editting code)
* PIN{ 4, 5, 6, 7 } use as output pins.
* PIN{ 8, 9, 10, 11 } use as input pins.

# Requirements  

* Arduino need something MIDI interface, eg MIDI Shield or [USB-MIDI](https://github.com/kuwatay/mocolufa) .
  * If Use USB-MIDI, you need to flash firmware to Atmega16u2 using [dfu-programmer](https://dfu-programmer.github.io/) or [Atmel FLIP](https://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails/PartNO/FLIP).
* [MIDI Library](https://playground.arduino.cc/Main/MIDILibrary/) 4.3.1

# How to use  

1. Write sketch to Arduino.  
1. Make grid array of switch.  
1. Connect cable to switch.

â€»To write sketch, you need to jumper ISP,Otherwise your Arduino are detected as MIDI device so that can't write sketch.
